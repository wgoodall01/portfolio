My friend had this huge container of Pokemon cards to sort through, and he was planning to make a spreadsheet to keep track of everything. However, I didn't have much to do that day so I challenged myself to see if I could throw together a simple CRUD app to manage his Pokemon cards in an couple hours or so. It ended up working pretty well.
