This is my personal dotfiles repo. I have all my config settings in there, along with a script that should set up a fresh Ubuntu install with i3wm, nvim, and everything else working out of the box. It also stores encrypted SSH keys, which it decrypts and copies into ~/.ssh with a user-provided password.

This is super handy, because it is also a good way to keep settings in sync between my various development VMs.
